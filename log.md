# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the form assignment for the odin project.

**Thoughts** Struggled a bit with some basic html and css, should not have breeze passed the basics. Did have to go back and look at the basics again, specially flexbox and such.

### Day 2: March 16, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on nulls and undefined for a exercism project - Amusement Park.

**Thoughts** The thought process was quite easy, but I kept missing basic syntax which was annoying, guess it's my fault for not coding java in 28 days.

### Day 3: March 17, 2025

**Today's Progress** Recreating a website for a odin project assingment.

**Thoughts** It's been quite fun, coding is very project learning and I don't feel that I'm learning nearly as much when I'm reading, so actually doing this project has been beneficial.
Need to create an html website for this log.

### Day 4: March 18, 2025

**Today's Progress** Exercism task, lasagna master

**Thoughts** Took a bit longer than expected, but found it quite easy.

### Day 5: March 19, 2025

**Today's Progress** Continuing development of the website landing page assignment

**Thoughts** Finding html positioning easier, requires practice.

### Messed up 4 days. Back to square 1

### Day 1: March 25, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Finished foundations chapter on odins project

**Thoughts** Did my first DOM exercises today, quite interesting. Interesting that the javascript path on exercism hasn't touched on these topics (yet?)
