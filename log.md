# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: March 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the form assignment for the odin project.

**Thoughts** Struggled a bit with some basic html and css, should not have breeze passed the basics. Did have to go back and look at the basics again, specially flexbox and such.
