# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 15, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the form assignment for the odin project.

**Thoughts** Struggled a bit with some basic html and css, should not have breeze passed the basics. Did have to go back and look at the basics again, specially flexbox and such.

### Day 2: March 16, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Worked on nulls and undefined for a exercism project - Amusement Park.

**Thoughts** The thought process was quite easy, but I kept missing basic syntax which was annoying, guess it's my fault for not coding java in 28 days.
